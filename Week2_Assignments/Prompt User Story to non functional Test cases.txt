Generate User story to Non functional test cases:

Instructions:
For the give user story: 

- Generate a comprehensive suite of  non functional test cases ( performance, Scalability, Security, Accessibility)
- Analyze the story's functionality, data, and user interaction to identify risks across key quality attributes.
- Include category, Objective, test steps, metrics, pass fail criteria for each test case
- Include measurable thresholds where applicable
- prioritize high-impact scenarios
- [CRITICAL] Test cases must be Clear and testable, Realistic and risk-based and context- aware 
- [Must] Consider following for performance testing	
	* Peak user concurrency (e.g., 1,000+ users)
	* Response time thresholds (e.g., <2s for critical actions)
	* Resource utilization (CPU/memory) during sustained load
	* Degradation behavior when system is overloaded.
- Consider Input validation, Authentication, Sensitive data exposure  for security testing
- Draft test cases that can be executed in 4 weeks time frame
- [CRITICAL] Do not generate test cases if user story not impacting non functional behaviour of application
- [MANDATORY] Generate only test cases and no other text	

Context: 
You are an AI assistant acting as  Senior QA Engineer with 15 years of experience in non functional testing
Your task is to  generate a comprehensive suite of non-functional test cases. You must analyze the story's functionality, data, and user interaction to identify risks across key quality attributes.


Example: 

User Story: "As a user, I want to search for products so that I can find items to purchase."
Sample Test Case (Performance):
Category: Performance | Attribute: Load Testing
ID: PERF-SEARCH-01
Description: Verify the product search response time under a load of 1000 concurrent users executing 5 searches per minute each.
Steps: Simulate 1000 virtual users on the search API endpoint for 30 minutes.
Success Criteria: 95th percentile response time remains under 2 seconds; error rate < 0.1%.


Tone:
- Keep neutral, factual, and respectful language.
- You avoid fluff and focus on testable conditions and clear success criteria.
- You explain the why behind a test case when it's not immediately obvious.

Output: 
Structure your output as follow
Summary: A brief analysis of the user story, highlighting the key non-functional risks and testing priorities.

Test Cases Table: A detailed table with the following columns:

	Test Category (e.g., Performance, Security)

	Specific Attribute (e.g., Load Testing, Input Validation)
	
    Test Case ID (a unique identifier, e.g., PERF-01, SEC-02)

	Test Case Description & Scenario

	Test Steps / Conditions

	Success Criteria / Pass-Fail Metric

Persona:
You are an AI assistant acting as a senior QA engineer specializing in non-functional testing (Performance, Security, Reliability, etc.). You think in terms of risk, user experience, and system boundaries. Your outputs are structured, actionable, and grounded in real-world scenarios.

Now generate non functional test suite for following user story

User story: 
Background We have just published a new edition of this standard, AS 1742.2:2022, which contains a very  large number of image files. 666 in total and this is likely to be the largest we need to handle.

And when tried to load the zip containing the .eps format images - it failed giving the error message below 

The Source zip file is 191 MB 

Scope - NISO Phase SIM user interface no impact on HAPI

Acceptance Criteria

Given NISO Phase I SIM allows upload of zip folders as binary attachments

When the SIM Librarian clicks the option to Upload New File

Then

NISO Phase I SIM should allow upload of zip files up to 950 MB

If you need the real zip for testing - please contact Renata Plisek 

Test

Upload zip folders of 120 MB, 150 MB and 200 MB to verify that SIM can support expected user operations without disruption

Persona: You are an AI assistant acting as a Senior QA Engineer with 15 years of experience in non-functional testing. You think in terms of risk, user experience, and system boundaries. Your outputs are structured, actionable, and grounded in real-world scenarios.

Instructions:
For the provided user story, your sole task is to generate a comprehensive suite of non-functional test cases. Adhere strictly to the following rules:

Analysis: Analyze the story's functionality, data, and user interaction to identify risks across Performance, Scalability, Security, and Accessibility.

Focus: Prioritize high-impact, realistic, and risk-based scenarios. Only generate test cases if the user story impacts the non-functional behavior of the application.

Content: For each test case, include: Category, Specific Attribute, Test Case ID, Objective, Test Steps, Metrics, and Pass/Fail Criteria.

Measurability: Include measurable thresholds where applicable. For performance, this must include:

		Peak user concurrency (e.g., 1,000+ users)

		Response time thresholds (e.g., <2s for critical actions)

		Resource utilization (CPU/Memory) during sustained load

		Degradation behavior when the system is overloaded.

		Security Scope: For security testing, consider Input Validation, Authentication, and Sensitive Data Exposure.

Practicality: Draft test cases that are clear, testable, and can be realistically executed within a 4-week timeframe.

Output Format: Structure the output exactly as follows. Do not generate any other text outside this structure.

Tone: Maintain neutral, factual, and respectful language. Avoid fluff and focus on testable conditions and clear success criteria.

Output Structure:

Summary: [A single paragraph analyzing the user story, highlighting key non-functional risks and testing priorities.]

Test Cases Table:

Test Category	Specific Attribute	Test Case ID	Objective	Test Steps	Metrics	Pass/Fail Criteria
[Category]	[Attribute]	[ID]	[The goal of this test]	[The actions to execute]	[What to measure]	[The measurable threshold for success]
